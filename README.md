## About the Video Course
Go is one of the most powerful, efficient, and highly performant programming languages. This video course teaches you how to deploy a full-stack Go application to a cloud-based production environment.

We start off by showing you how to provision a virtual server instance on the Linode cloud, install MySQL and Nginx, and obtain and install a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. We introduce you to Linode, a major cloud provider of virtual private servers. Then you’ll see how cross-compile a Go application, prepare and deploy a production deployment bundle, and turn a Go application into a system service.

Moving on, you’ll find out how to dockerize a Go application and use the Docker Compose tool to define and run a multi-container Docker application. Finally, you’ll see how to turn a dockerized Go application into a system service.

The code bundle for this course is available at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Go-Production-Deployments
